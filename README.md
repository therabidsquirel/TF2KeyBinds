# the_rabidsquirel's Team Fortress 2 Key Binds

You have my permission to use part or all of my binds for your personal use, I only request that if you take any part of my binds and post or share them anywhere that you cite me.

Hello and welcome! These are my custom key binds for the video game Team Fortress 2, located in the configs directory. I decided to throw them in a repository here so I could easily make them public and accessible to anyone. I feel I've done my best to comment the more confusing parts of them, but if you have any questions then feel free to contact me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_rabidsquirel/) by adding me. I'll try to get to you as soon as I can. I'm also open to writing binds for people, so if that interests you then again just contact me on Steam. I would make a new branch here so that you could download what I wrote for you, no GitHub account required.

If you want to download any of them navigate to the specific file and click on the "Raw" button, then save from there. Your browser might try to append a ".txt" to the end of it, you'll want to remove that as the extension needs to be ".cfg". If you want to just download everything, then at the root level of the repository you can click the "Download ZIP" button. If I've written something for you I can give you the direct link to download it.

If I've possibly inspired you and/or you're interested in writing your own binds but you don't know where to start, here are a couple good places to get a lot of information:
- [The TF2 wiki](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting)
- [A subreddit for TF2 scripting help](https://en.reddit.com/r/tf2scripthelp/wiki/introduction)
- [A list of TF2 commands and variables](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_TF2_console_commands_and_variables)
